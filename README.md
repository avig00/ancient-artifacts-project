# sp23-ancient-artifacts-team8

This repository hosts code and files for Team 8’s micro debitage classifier model. Using machine learning models, we’re working to identify soil/lithic samples. Our main coding language here is Python, and our progress will be tracked using GitHub’s Project boards.

While creating an effective model, we will also identify the variables with the highest importance while keeping our model interpretable. This could require feature reduction and other data cleaning steps. At present, the most effective model identified is random forest.

This project will run through February 6.

## Team Purpose:

### Vision: 
Classify the microdebitage samples using  Machine Learning models

### Mission:
We will achieve our vision by engaging in good teamwork and collaboration practices. This entails communicating effectively during regular meetings, dividing the workload fairly,  planning out the project and staying organized, and being productive by following an Agile workflow. This is important because this will allow us to complete the project on time and to a high degree of quality while making sure that all team members contribute equally. This experience will prepare us well for careers in data science, since this is how data science teams in industry work on their projects. 

## Team Goals:
1. Optimizing models to classify soil/lithic samples
2. Practicing python skills for EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and so on
   - Explore different models (for multi-class or multi-label): Tree-based (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoosting), logistic regression, KNN, SVM; PCA for feature selection
3. Practicing working as a team with different skill sets
   - Communicate all the time (which part someone what to focus on more, what problem someone is facing, what kind of help they want from other teammates)
   - Helping each other familiar with GitHub flow, AGILE
      Use comments in issues to discuss problems and questions with teammates so we can track progress and hangups
   - Come to group meeting, actively discuss ideas
